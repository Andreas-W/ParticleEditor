Random discoveries during testing
--------------
-) Volume Type BOX + IsHollow does not work properly.
Particles appear in a straigt line at one half side of the box

-) VolType BOX +
--) VelType Outward:
VelOutward is the velocity from the center of the box (in direction of Box position).
velOutwardOther does nothing
--) VelType SPHERICAL:
Direction is pure random
--) VelType HEMISPHERICAL:
As Expected, same as spherical
--) VelType ORTHO: As Expected; direction orients with object
--) VelType CYLINDRICAL: Like Spherical, but with Cylinder coordinates

-) Velocity Types seem to be independant of volume, except Outward

Tests of VelocityType OUTWARD:
----
-BOX
--VelOutward is the velocity from the center of the box (in direction of Box position).
--velOutwardOther does nothing
-POINT
--VelOutward is pure random velocity (see spherical)
--VelOutwardOther does nothing
-LINE (This is a bit tricky)
--VelOutward is Velocity in direction Normal to Line Vector (sideways)
--VelOutwardOther is Velocity in direction to line Vector (upwards)
-SPHERE
--VelOutward is velocity in sphere direction
--VelOutwardOther does nothing
-CYLINDER
--VelOutward is velocity in cylinder radial dir
--VelOutwardOther is upwards velocity



-) VelocityDamping applies to gravity and velocity, but not to DriftVelocity
