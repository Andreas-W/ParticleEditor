How to create FX with the ParticleEditor
----------------------------------------

-) Browsing Particles/FX

- The panel on the left shows a list of all currently loaded FXLists and Particles.
- If you set up the folders with you're mods FXList/ParticleSystem .ini files, you can view any of your effects.
- You can switch between viewing FX or single ParticleSystems.
- Use the Filter Textfield to search for specific effects
- 'Browse All' contains all loaded Particles/FX, 'Working Set' contains all modified or added Particles/FX


-) Creating a new FX

- Choose an FXList on the left and click 'clone' to create a copy
- click 'new' to create a new empty one
- you can also select an existing FX to modifiy it directly



-) FX Edit Panel

- On the right you can see the Edit Panel for the currently selected FX
- it contains a (possibly empty) list of ParticleSystems for this FX (in FXList/Edit Values)
- 'Add ParticleSystem' adds a new entry

- ParticleSystem Entries correspond to the entries within an FXList in FXList.ini
-- In the dropdown list you can choose which ParticleSystem to use
-- The checkbox to the left can be used to hide/show this entry (this is only used within this editor)
-- Right-click the checkbox, for some additional options

- Right-click the dropdown-list:
-- 'Duplicate this Entry' : Adds a new entry with the same ParticleSystem (the other values are currently not filled in yet)
-- 'Add new ParticleSystem' : Allows you to create a new empty ParticleSystem for this position
-- 'Clone ParticleSystem' : Create a new ParticleSystem from the currently chosen System

-- the '[X]' button will remove the entry from the FX (not the actual ParticleSystem)


-) Particle Edit Panel

Click the 'Particle Systems' tab on the top right side
Here you can edit ParticleSystems.

The dropdown-list at the top contains all the ParticleSystems that are used in the current FX
Select one to edit it.
The fields directly correspond to the various entries in ParticleSystems.ini

You can add, remove or move Color or Alpha entries via the buttons.

(Check the ModuleList or any Particle tutorial for information about the parameters)


-) How to store your progress

There are 2 ways to save your FX.

1.) Directily save to your game's ParticleSystem and FXList .ini files (via File -> Save menu)
This method is not 100% safe yet and is currently not recommended. It will NOT modify any existing entries from your .ini files, but there are sometimes issues that modified entries are not properly saved.

2.) (RECOMMENDED!) Export to a textfile:
-- Click 'Export WorkingSet to file' in the File menu. Save as a text file in an arbitrary folder. This includes all modified ParticleSystems and FXLists in the same file.
Use this if you want to add your effects to the game manually or as a backup save.

You can later continue your work from where you left off by using the 'Import WorkingSet from File' option.
